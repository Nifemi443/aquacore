- Active Record, raw SQLAlchemy in services

## Rationale

Testability; future DB migration flexibility.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Aligns with Clean Architecture and production readiness goals defined in Phase 4.

### Negative / Trade-offs

- Requires team discipline to avoid bypassing the chosen pattern under delivery pressure.
